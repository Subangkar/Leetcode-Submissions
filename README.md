# Leetcode-Submissions

Submission files of my solved leetcode problems. And just one added python script to automate the organization of the source files downloaded from leetcode.

Thanks to [leetcode-export](https://github.com/NeverMendel/leetcode-export) for their tool to export all previous submissions from leetcode at one command. The used command:
```bash
leetcode-export --no-problem-statement --only-accepted --only-last-submission
```
Then to rename files:
```bash
python flatten_and_rename.py ./
```
